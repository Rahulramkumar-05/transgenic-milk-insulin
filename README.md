# Production of Human Proinsulin in Transgenic Cattle Milk

## Abstract
The growing demand for human insulin to treat diabetes has led to innovative solutions, such as producing insulin in the milk of transgenic animals. This study aimed to produce human proinsulin in the milk of transgenic cattle using a pseudo-lentivirus containing the bovine β-casein promoter and human insulin sequences. The process involved generating modified adult fibroblasts, performing nuclear transfer, and analyzing the recombinant protein in milk using Western blotting and mass spectrometry.

## Key Terms
- **Beta Cells:** Found in the pancreas, these cells regulate blood sugar levels and play a key role in diabetes management.
- **Polypeptide:** Hormones made up of amino acids linked in chains, essential for insulin function.
- **Insulin:** A hormone secreted by beta cells that regulates blood glucose levels and induces glucose storage in the liver.
- **Proinsulin:** The precursor to insulin made by beta cells.
- **Preproinsulin:** The initial product of insulin mRNA translation.
- **Transgenic:** Organisms or cells with genomes altered by introducing foreign DNA sequences.

## Objective
To address the global demand for human insulin by producing it in the milk of transgenic cattle, leveraging milk’s natural protein production capabilities.

## Methodology

### Transgenic Vector Construction
- A lentiviral vector was constructed with the bovine β-casein promoter and human insulin gene (hINS).
- The hINS gene was amplified, cloned, and sequenced to confirm its accuracy.

### Cell Line Generation and Transduction
- Human insulin expression in MAC-T cells driven by the bovine β-casein promoter was evaluated.
- Modified bovine fibroblasts were used for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to generate transgenic embryos.

### Embryo Transfer and Pregnancy Monitoring
- Transgenic embryos were transferred to recipient cows, resulting in one successful pregnancy and the birth of a transgenic calf.

### Lactation and Protein Analysis
- Lactation was hormonally induced to produce milk for analysis.
- Western blotting was used to identify bands corresponding to proinsulin and insulin.
- Mass spectrometry was used to confirm the presence of human insulin and its C-peptide, indicating successful expression and processing of the recombinant protein.

## Results
- Sequence alignment of the hINS gene showed mutations in the intronic region.
- Transgenic MAC-T cells successfully expressed the hINS gene.
- One transgenic calf was born, and PCR analysis confirmed the presence of the transgene.
- Western blotting and mass spectrometry validated the presence of human insulin in the milk, suggesting the conversion of proinsulin to insulin.

## Pros
- Potential for scaling up insulin production using transgenic animals, which can produce large quantities of milk.
- Cost-effective: Producing insulin in cow’s milk could be cheaper than in factories.
- Consistent supply: Cows can provide a steady and reliable supply of insulin, benefiting diabetic patients worldwide.

## Cons
- Technically challenging and resource-intensive to create transgenic animals and ensure consistent protein expression.
- Ethical issues concerning genetic modification in animals, including animal welfare and long-term ecological impacts.
- Potential reproductive issues: Not all transgenic cows may be healthy or able to reproduce well.

## Conclusion
This study successfully demonstrated the production of human proinsulin in the milk of a transgenic cow using a lentiviral vector with the bovine β-casein promoter. This approach shows promise for meeting the growing demand for human insulin through biopharmaceutical production in transgenic animals.
